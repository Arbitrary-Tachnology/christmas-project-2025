            <h2>Face</h2>
            <p>Faces are by far where most of my experience with character creation lies. From the detailed eyes to proportions, everything goes into making a face work. I have spent many hours working on eyes because they are very fun to draw and can be in many different styles</p>

            <h2>Color</h2>
            <p>Color is very important. If the character is too dark of a color, they will blend in with shadows. If the character is too bright, they will stand out. Finding colors that work together without making them too noticable or too unnoticable is a delicate balance.</p>

            <p>Designing bodies for characters is something that takes a lot of work. You have to worry about proportions and how the clothes look on the character.</p>
