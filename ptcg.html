            <h2>The Best Pokemon</h2>
            <p>There are 2 Pokemon from Unova, Zorua and Zoroark that are my favorite Pokemon ever. They both have illistration rares in the set as well. My favorite Pokemon trainer N is also in the set with an illistration rare and special illistration rare. </p>

            <h2>Booster Bundle</h2>
            <p>A booster bundle has 6 packs of cards. I hope to get both because that would be 12 packs which gives me better odds oof getting good cards.</p>

            <h2>Binder Collection</h2>
            <p>Each binder collection contains 5 packs and a binder that holds some cards. This would allow me to organize some of my cards (specifically my growing Zorua and Zoroark collection) and have them in a specialized binder.</p>
