            <h2>She is the Reason I Started Playing the Game</h2>
            <p>When I was first learning about Umamusume, I was very hesitent. I had negative thoughts towards it and thought the concept was done. Then some of my friends introduced me to some of the characters. I thought some of them were cool, but not enough to start playing the game. Then they told me about Manhattan Cafe, and I've been playing ever since.</p>
