            <h2>New Survivors</h2>
            <p>Silver and Blaze were added, allowing more options to play as. Silver is a support and survivalist who throws rocks to slow the executioner and grabs the executioners to keep them from moving. Blaze is a support that can do some stuns and apply burning effect.</p>

            <p>They added two new executions, Tripwire and Kolossos. Tripwire is a trapper who places mines to stop survivors from going in a certain direction. Kolossos is rush down executioner who excels at getting survivors gone early then picking off those that remain.</p>

            <p>They added 2 new maps and reworked a different one. Both of the new maps, although they look cool, are really big and difficult to find anyone one. The rework of Green Hill also looks amazing, but is very large and easy to get lost on.</p>
